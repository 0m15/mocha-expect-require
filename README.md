Mocha + expect + requirejs
--------------------------

A bouilerplate for testing your amd modules with mocha and expect js.
Just clone, check out the source, then add specs under `test/specs` and require it into the `runner.js`.

You should now point your browser to `/test/runner.html`.

I usually prefer `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to easily serve the directory under `http://localhost:8000`.
